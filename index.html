            <h3>ASU Senior Capstone: Web Application</h3>
            <img src="images/essay_logo.png" alt="Dads Against Depression Essay Competition Logo">
            <p>Our team, a group of four senior Software Engineering students at ASU, is developing a cloud-based responsive website that allows schools from any district to sign-up for an essay competition. Deliverables include source code in a git repository, DevOps CICD build and release Pipelines for the application, and design and architecture documentation.</p>
            <p>Team members take turns fulfilling Project Management roles including Scrum Master and Product Owner. We also share responsibilities regarding sprint progression and communicating with our client.</p>
            <p>The motivation of this project is derived from a lack of mental health awareness in youth at a high school level, as well as the community of families who experience the tragedy of losing their children to their battles with depression. The client, Dads Against Depression (D.A.D.) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that was organized by Natarajan Nellicherry. The mission of this organization is to help families and other adults that closely work with children learn to identify and provide support for youth struggling with mental health conditions.</p>
